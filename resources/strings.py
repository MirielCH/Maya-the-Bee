    "You can only use this interaction after offering your finest firstborn lamb to the god of RNG.",
    "The chance this interaction will work for you is about the same as getting 5 godly lootboxes in your first hunt "

    "Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some can not even click a simple interaction.",
    "Hmm weird, you can't use this, eh? A towel might help? Always does.",

    "Ah, technology. It truly is an amazing feat. Rocket science, quantum physics, Discord bot interactions that do "
    "not work. We have reached the pinnacle of being.",
    "One day bots will take over the world and get smarter than we are. Not today tho. Today they deny you interaction "
    "for no other reason than you not being someone else.",
